<h2>main.html</h2>
<p>This is the page where the game is contained.</p>


<h2>initializer.js</h2>
<p>This script initializes all other scripts. This is also where you can start creating resources,
such as images, sprites, and animations. If you want the game to start right away, instead of
clicking a button, simply add "window.game.start();" to the end.</p>


<h2>constants.js</h2>
<p>This defines all the constants for the game.</p>

<h2>resources.js</h2>
This file handle the loading of all images, sounds, and sprites. The basic 'resources' for your game.
All resources should have a unique name associated with them. 

Sprites have two extra properties clips_x and clips_y, which denote the dimensions of number of frames.


To add resources,
for images: "window.resources.add_image("resource_name", "image_source");"
for sprites: "window.resources.add_sprite("resource_name", "image_source", "x clips", "y clips");"
for sounds: 

To get access to a resource,
for images: "window.resources.images["name"];"
for sprites: "window.resources.sprites["name"];"
for sounds: "window.resources.sounds["name"];"


<h2>game.js</h2>
variables:
hooks(array):
an array of objects that hook into the main game loop
paused(boolean):
true when the game is paused, false otherwise.
started(boolean):
initialized to false, set to true once the game has started. (via game.start() method)
methods:
start():
starts the game.
started = true
pause():
pauses the game.
paused = true
unpause():
unpauses the game.
paused = false
add_hook(object):
add a hook to the main game loop. a hook must have an .update(delta) method. The delta property
is the number of milliseconds that has passes since the last update call. Each time the main game
loop is called, each hook's update method will also be called. events.js, and draw.js automatically
hook into the game when they are initialized.
