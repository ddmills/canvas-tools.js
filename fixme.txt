1.) REMOVED window.draw ques
window.draw.image_que, window.draw.sub_image_que, and window.draw.animation_que 
should all act more like ques. Right now it will only loop through and
remove elements which are loaded. It should preserve the order. (look at
the window.draw.update() method.

2.) DONE window.draw.update()
right now 32 is hardcoded for spritesize offset x/y scaling, and the offset h/w. 
It should be changed to:
off_w = anim.sprite.image.width/anim.clips[0]
off_h = anim.sprite.image.height/anim.clips[1]
off_x = anim.clip[0] * off_w
off_y = anim.clip[1] * off_h

3.) DONE window.draw.update() and Animation (in draw.js)
Animation should have it's own .draw() method

4.) ???? Animation should be extracted from draw.js into it's own file.

5.) DONE Add rotation for images and animations

6.) DONE animations shouldn't be updating every single frame, only when they need to. 

7.) DONE Separate window.draw, panning/zooming/camera capabilites into window.viewport!!!!

8.) DONE make active window appear above others

9.) clean up scenario_gui.js. divide windows into their own files?

10.) fix mip-mapping for certain draw layers! ('background??')

11.) get rid of initializer.js maybe??

12.) DONE create a set 'area' for jquery.windower.js

13.) background not drawing on startup? maybe has something to do with requestAnimFrame()??
